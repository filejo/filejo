- 👋 Hi, I’m @filejo. I develop browser-based core business applications.
- 👀 I'm interested in Node, Express, Client JavaScript (browser), CSS, HTML, and SQL Server.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on a broad business application for a service provider in the supply chain import/export niche.
- 💞️ I’m willing to help others with SQL Server and JSON objects.
- 📫 How to reach me ... send email to brianm@santinipackers.com  
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... I've been coding since 1980.
